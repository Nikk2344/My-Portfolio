        My Journey
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Born in a small village, <strong>Dharikpur</strong>, in the city of Jaunpur,
        just as the early monsoon arrived in July. My educational roots began there,
        before I moved to <strong>Kota, Rajasthan</strong> for Intermediate studies.
        Later, I pursued my <strong>BCA at Axis Colleges, Kanpur (2021–2024)</strong>,
        where I explored coding, made projects like Spotify Clone and Book Library
        using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Tailwind</strong>, and gained foundational skills
        in OS, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, MySQL, and Oracle.
        <br /><br />
        I’m now pursuing my <strong>MCA</strong> and working in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. But this
        is just my first step. I want to grow further, expand my impact,
        and continue learning and building.
